VISP has the objective to develop a model-based decision support that allow manufacturers to offer a greater flexibility without comprising production efficiency. At present, no modeling and simulation support exist to support system architects and platform development teams in these trade-offs. Too much resource is consumed to manage increasing diversification that follow from the introduction of radically new technologies resulting in unwanted adjustments and changes in production.
