Ivar´s research deals with “root cause analysis of late product changes”. His project aims at enhancing product quality and lower the total product development cost. The project participants are Volvo Group Trucks Technology and Chalmers University of Technology. Truck development projects can last several years and be variant-rich. Many decisions need to be changed during the course of the project, e.g., due to emergence of new information. It is well known that change made late in a development project are very costly and cause delays. This project aims to develop and implement approaches to eliminate root causes for late changes, and to shift remaining changes to earlier phases. Fundamental knowledge for the project will be; big data analysis, product development methodology, and quality Six Sigma.
