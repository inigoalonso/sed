Massimo's main research focus is on developing models for determining the lifecycle value of a new engineering system. The ability to properly evaluate the value of complex systems is becoming even more critical as customers, stakeholders and society require the fulfillment of more sophisticated needs and expectations.Massimo earned his PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology in 2015. This followed both a Bachelor and Master degree in Mechanical Engineering earned at University of Padua (Italy) in 2008 and 2011 respectively.
