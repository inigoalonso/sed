The research work is an industrial PhD project at GKN Aerospace Engine Systems, Sweden that specializes in the design and manufacture of aero engine static structures. The company is a tier-1 supplier to major aero engine OEMâ€™s. The research objective is to investigate how static engine structures are affected by changes in engine architectures (for example how would the structure need to change when a two shaft turbo-fan engine is replaced with a geared turbo-fan engine for the same power output) and how a design change at a component level might influence overall engine performance. Knowledge of how components are affected due to change in engine architectures would result in improved designs for components, for example reduced weight. Knowledge of how overall engine performance is affected by component behavior would enable engine manufacturers make meaningful trade-offs regarding selection and usage of components. The project in overall aim to enable informed design decisions for aero-engine structural components that could lead to efficient engines with lower fuel burns and reduced emissions.
