Methodology for product innovation is the core of my teaching and research. Specifically, I am skilled in management of requirements, with focus on the role of requirements in product innovation. My work typically concerns products that integrate many different technologies and often include mechanics, software and services.I frequently take part in multi-disciplinary research projects that involve many parties and subject areas. Themes for research include: Balancing of requirements and synthesis of product concepts, Methodology for service innovation, Multi-disciplinary product innovation, and Designing products from a lifecycle perspective.
