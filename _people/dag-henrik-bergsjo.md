I am conducting research within the area of Lean product development, systems engineering and platform development (Technology, product and production platforms).My responsibilities include developing the research field of "Platform Based Development". I am also interested in the integration of lean product development and product data/lifecycle management (PDM/PLM). Especially Lean product development tools such as Puls, visual planning and checksheets are of interest.
